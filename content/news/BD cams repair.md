Update \[27 November]:

The cams repair service in the US stopped, and the service in Europe is not ready yet (they say it will be there soon). So for now we will put the reslinging on hold and we'll let you know when we know more about the situation.

Resling your BD cams!

LUAK is going to resling its cams via Kariboe. The batch will be sent out by the end of next week, so do you also have Black Diamond (BD) cams that are still in good condition but have old slings? Don't hesitate to bring them to Kariboe or LUAK before Saturday 7/12 so that they are shipped with the same batch.

\- Only Black Diamond cams can be repaired because BD only reslings its own cams.

\- The cams will probably be sent to the US, we don't know how long it will take but foresee that it could take up to a few months, that's why we do it in the winter btw ;).

\- We don't know the price yet, if we do we'll keep you informed. On the BD website we found it is 10USD to resling a cam in the US (the actual price could be different), shipping costs will also add to this.

\- Very very important is to MARK YOUR CAMS, not on the sling because that will be removed of course.

\- You can drop your cams @Kariboe or @LUAK before Saturday 7 December.

LOLL (Lots of LUAK love)
