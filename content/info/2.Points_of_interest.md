## 🧭 All the spots you need to know as a climber in Leuven

#title
🏠 LUAK Clubhouse

#content
The LUAK clubhouse is where we meet every week for a chat and a beer, a party, the Christmas party, lend a guidebook (topo) or climbing gear...

### Drinks

The fridge is full of delicious beers & drinks. You pay the amount noted on the fridge door by putting it in the destined container. If you ask if anyone else wants a drink, you also pay for it... But don't worry, the favor will definitively be returned sooner or later.

### Gear or books

Lending gear or books is free, but there is a pledge to be paid (5 to 25 euros depending on the type). Ask the gear guy or anyone of the board to do so!

### Location

We're located in the Minderbroederstraat, opposite nr. 25, behind the cast iron gate. Check our points of interest map and the pictures below to help you out.
