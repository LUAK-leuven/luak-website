We start at the beginning, that fatefull day at the epicenter of the universe, on the plateau in a sea of grey. 
It was a nice sunny day, spring of 2022. I was out climbing with Simon and having recently send my first 7a+ (cocaine fingers) 
I was looking for a new challenge. Simon recommended this one route, called Manhattan transfer, and being Simon he probably neglected to mention the + after the 7b. 
I didn't know it at the time, but there on that day I would set the first steps on a long and arduous journey that would change the climber I am. 

A few years later on October 30 2025, I wake up in a particularly good mood. I only slept 6 hours but I felt a driving force that made me confident this would be the day. We arrived at the plateau of Al'legne, the queen of Freyr and most beautiful wall in Belgium, at around 14h. Having earlier made the joke that I would do Manhattan as a warmup so I could work out tartine after that, Mo let me climb first that day. 

Breathe in, breathe out, calm your mind and focus on the task before you. As I scramble up to the first bolt I remember that first day oh so long ago. That first try, with a lot of struggle, I managed to do all the individual moves. I felt I would be able to do this route quite quickly after some projecting. Oh how wrong I was. 
CLIP Having made the first clip the climbing starts. I feel for the hidden pocket with my left hand, take the slanted crimp with my right, smear the left foot, go to a good right foothold and stand up. Two Jugs further the second CLIP. Right hand small undercling, left hand gaston and I lean to the left to put my right foot close to my right hand. This enables me to take the good right underhand jug. After this I put my left foot high on the ledge and in one smooth motion pull and push myself upright on the ledge. CLIP here I lean to the rock and release my hands. Breathe in, breathe out, I feel the rock with my face and visualize all the moves to come. 

Here I remember another session, on Sunday morning of Freyr-weekend. Having  slept for less then 6 hours for three days in a row, but still fresh from a midnight skinny dip in the Maas the night before, me and hector warm up on a 6b in the RAB section and then continue to Manhattan. That try, despite or because of the fatigued state of mind, was one of the best I would have for a long time, making it past all the hard parts to fall in the last crux going to the victory pocket. But just like that day I am now getting ahead of myself. 

Once I am totally calm, I depart from the ledge to traverse to the right on 2 chipped holds with feet on friction, a left foot up, match, foot-swap and traverse to the left bring me to the weird sideways but comfortable CLIP. After this I stand up and take more time breathe, mentally preparing myself for the first crux coming up. Left foot higher, with left hand to the biggest jug you will find outside of Les prises taillées, right foot high and sideways so I can search with my right hand for the hidden sideways pocket. CLIP

The coming sequence is one of the three cruxes, perhaps the easiest but at times the most painful. I could do this crux 10 times in a row to then suddenly fall on the 11th try and become discouraged. I do a match on the pocket, take a little crimp with right, but right foot higher, so I can move my right hand to the small, weird pocket crimp pinch thingy. Now I walk up my feet so I can put my left foot high (close to the previous pocket) and hope the pulleys in my right hand don't give out and I go with left to the first of the 4 crimps that traverse to the left. right, CLIP, left, right, left to a pocket, right to a good undercling, left to an even better one. CLIP. 2 underclings further I find myself in a good rest position CLIP. Right now I am breathing quite heavily so I take as long as I need for my breathing to calm down. 

I feel the slight breeze, the cool autumn sun, the shape of the holds, I put my heel on the rock to relax my toes. I am where I want to be, dancing in a sea of grey on a beautiful day. 

A few sideways holds and I come up to the last good rest. CLIP. breathe in, breathe out. Left foot on the small black rail, I make sure to keep enough space to match my right foot later, right foot 15cm higher, I cross over to take a crimp-pinch with my right and slowly move to take the left sideways hold. Carefully I match my feet, left foot to a good slanted foot, I throw my right foot high on the jug I held a few moments before, I go with the right to the lower part of the next good hold. I palm my left to make space to put my left foot and match the hold with my left hand. 

I shake. Now its go time. Before me 2 more clips, 2 cruxes and after that... 

Right hand sideways, left to the crimpy rail. I match and I make the tiring CLIP. On the next move I have fallen how many times? I don't know. This is the move that has been preventing me this season, the previous 3 tries I've fallen here and then breezed through the last part. As I put my left foot on the sloper-pimple, I stand up higher. I take the dreaded undercling with my left. I hope I don't suddenly slip of like I did once previous year. I put my right foot higher on the somewhat hidden foot-hold, YES it feels solid this time. I stand up and don't feel the shakiness and hesitation I often feel here. Right thumbercling, I put left foot on the crimps and stand up to the left mono. Have I ever felt this solid here? I feel good but now a little stress creeps in, I make the last CLIP. My previous session I once again changed my beta for the last crux, for the 3th time, since then I haven't fallen there.

I put my middle two fingers in the undercling, put my right foot on the polished horizontal foothold, do a foot swap, I take the comfortable left undercling/pinch. I do another footswap. With my right I go to the right of three crimps, not the middle one that I used for 3 years, I swap my feet once more. I put my right foot on the black bulb just under the little roof. Keeping the tension I go to the left sideways hold, I was worried about this move but it feels solid. Now I need to put my left foot close to the right FUCK FUCK I DONT find it OOF I got it, now I put my right heel high close to my hand and I smile with relief. I know I got it. Taking the right undercling-pocket, switching to a higher left sideways hold, and putting my left foot above the roof. I think back on the times I've fallen on the first crux, the times I've fallen on the last 2 cruxes oh so close to the relais. As I make the 2 last moves and clip the relais I feel happiness, relief, emptiness, wonder, excitement, a mix of emotions too complicated to put to words but I'm sure some of you will understand. 

After 20-30-40? tries, I lost count, and countless mental tries , its over. 
As I am lowered to the ground and take in the view of the setting sun, I turn back to the wall and see a plentitude of lines unexplored waiting for me. 

I will have more projects in the future, more heartbreakingly close attemps, this will not be my hardest sent ever. But Manhattan transfer will always keep a place in my mind and heart as the first real challenge I overcame as a climber. 

I will not forget you. 

(by the way there is a 70s group called the Manhattan Transfer, their music did put me in the right mood when taking the train to Dinant)
