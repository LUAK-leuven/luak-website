Wow, I’m I in Orco? Val di Mello? No wait, I’m not staring at granite, this is limestone. ZIP – wake up, still in Belgium, just around the corner of the well known main slab of Les Awirs. But still, I am looking at an incredible 40m corner crack. It’s a bit overgrown and not bolted. But this is something to remember, potentially virgin rock in Belgium is something very rare to come by.

## Fastforward +- 1 year

Right after finding out about the crack I contacted my main partner in crime for dodgy uncharted shenanigans: Sebastiaan. Together we made it a goal of cleaning this crack and making the ascent. In the meanwhile we found out the guidebook mentions a line where the corner is found. “Superdiedre” reffered to as a project, not graded. Has it ever been climbed though? Or rather, has it ever ben lead, or is the first ascent still open?

The date is 15 december 2021 – lockdown week n° …… “stopped counting”. Status: unemployed. The weather is rather cold and the rock is humid. What is there to do… OF COURSE, let’s start cleaning THE PROJECT. Armed with a bike, general climbing gear, a couple of ropes, grigri’s and other rope climbing tats we leave Leuven with destination Les Awirs. We forgot the brushes though… but hey, who needs a brush when you have shoes and gloves.

After walking to the top to find an abseil tree, starting to abseil to find out we took a tree too far to the right we start again. To our surprise, after some bushwacking, we find some anchors. Most of them above bolted routes, but one is in perfect spot for the end of the ‘superdiedre’. Maybe not the best news for the first ascent status of the route, but anyway, it makes the cleaning a lot easier.

We abseil down cleaning the route, using everything we find to empty the crack and wall of dirt, moss and bushes. Some football sized rocks are loose as hell and are removed. But in general the rock quality is pretty good, the crack is clean, very climable and protectable using trad gear. After cleaning for a couple hours, we’re down and look at the result. It looks even more badass then before. Only thing is: we have to wait for the cleaned rock to dry out before giving it a shot.

## Fastforward again: to 28/02/2021

m not unemployed anymore but am dealing with some work-stress issues. Perfect time for a good climbing adventure to clear the mind ! The weather looks awesome, I’m super amped about the ascent of the project and couldn’t even wait to brag a bit about it in the luak whatsapp group. It didn’t look that hard anyway, what’s going to keep us from sending today!!

CAB….

Cleaning day in Awirs, the entire area full of people dropping rocks… We leave Awirs, but can’t really hide the disappointment.

## Finally the big day: 6/03/2021

Today really is THE day. Weather is awesome again. A new LUAK member Valerya joins me on the train, she is siked to take pictures from a static line. In Awirs we meet Sebastiaan who slept nearby, after joining the ‘mount coach 9’ hike.

Valeria in position after rapping down - on her left side 'the corner project'. The slab on the left side of the corner was just beautifully cleaned by the cab and hosts the 6c rochassiers.

Val and I walk to the top to abseil down, giving the line a last cleaning, and I bounce-test some cams. Fixing a ‘dynamic’ static line in the process. Meanwhile we notice the great work of the CAB Namur the previous week. The slab on the left has entirely been cleaned. So the 6c Rochassiers is climbable. Perfect warm-up, no? It’s actually a great route, with mostly one hard move and slab climbing with beautiful exposure.

Now we know we can climb the slab without crack, climbing a similar angled slab with a corner crack \_even though trad\_ shouldn’t be a problem.

The start is pretty easy, but the rock is kinda bad and trustworthy protection scarce. **Note to self** … don’t fall.

Once the first 15m are gone and a few solid placements have been put, I get into the zone. The climbing is easy but just beautiful. Laybacking, stemming, traversing a bit were the corner gets more horizontal. A perfect nut, a n°4 cam… this route just has everything. I make it to the anchor without problem, lower down and remove the placements.

**Damn that was just awesome!**

Next up Sebastiaan – who follows by fluidly sending the line. We notice quite a lot of our gear placements are the same. Wherever the climbing gets a bit more difficult the protection is great. In the easier parts sometimes the rock is a bit less quality.

We leave in the rope. Valeria never really climbed trad so decides to toprope the line – thus making the first toprope ascent (at least in recent history).

My name for it: **“Dièdre du soleil levant” grade 5’ish**

Overall, another great adventure close to home. Who can say if it was a first ascent or not. For us it felt like it – putting in the work of scouting the line – cleaning it and climbing it without any knowledge of other ascents.

For all of you thousand’s of enthousiastic readers who are now super psyched for some barely climbed, crunchy limestone, super-duper-mega-awesome-licious corner trad route. Here’s the manual:

\- Look for a great climbing partner - Go to Awirs (by train of course!! (Engis station), and enter the climbing area. - Look to the right and spot the most obvious line. - Bring cams 0.75-4 (some doubles won’t hurt if you want more), a couple alpine quickdraws, large nuts, (and other big nuts ;) ) - Climb the thing and have $$FUN$$

Thanks a lot Valeria for the company and the awesome pictures! (bonus)
