Did you know that we share our clubhouse with [Spekul](https://www.spekul.be/), the origin of LUAK, those people that spend their time in deep dark caves. On Saturday 26 April we organise a joint activity where people from both clubs can explore each others discipline.

The first half of the day will be an introduction to rock climbing (top-rope) in Spontin, and the second half of the day will be an introduction to caving, in the caves of Trou Haquin. This is a weekend to get to know our roommates, and try something new!
