Throughout October we will be going to De Stordeur with a group of LUAKkers to climb together. Everyone is welcome to come and meet new people and enjoy a session together. These evenings will be lively and full of company.

No registrations, just show up :) You will be responsible to pay for your own entry in the gym.
