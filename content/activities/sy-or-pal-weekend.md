The weekend of 28-29 March we are going on a climbing weekend (location TBA). This weekend is meant for beginners and beginner lead climbers. We will not give a full KVB2 course, but we'll happily explain everything you need to know in order to lead climb safely on the rocks (so at least knowing how lead climbing works is a plus). Of course experienced climbers can also join!

For this activity you need to be **member of KBF** or another federation affiliated to the UIAA. For the transport we'll arrange a carpool.

More info & registrations will be posted later.
