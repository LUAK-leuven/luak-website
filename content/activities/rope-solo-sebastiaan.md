Hey adventurous LUAK climbers,

After the succesful 1st edition, LUAK is organising a second series of rope solo climbing this spring.
If you are interested in learning how to Top Rope Solo or Lead Rope Solo, you can find the information in the PDF below*👇.
Ideal for when you are uneven, alone or want to project a route at your own pace. The course will be in English and/or Dutch
