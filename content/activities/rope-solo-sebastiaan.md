Hey adventurous LUAK climbers,

After the succesful 1st edition, LUAK is organising a second series of rope solo climbing this spring.
If you are interested in learning how to Top Rope Solo or Lead Rope Solo, you can find the information in [this PDF](/activities/LRS_TRS_Maart2026_Poster_V2_Horizontal.pdf){target="blank_"} (you can scan the QR codes or click on the links 'informatie' and 'sign up').
Ideal for when you are uneven, alone or want to project a route at your own pace. The course will be in English and/or Dutch.
