For the initiation we are going to Hotton, a cozy climbing crag in the Ourthe valley.

The initiation is meant for beginners, so no experience needed. The experienced members of LUAK will hang topropes and give a quick demo of how to belay and climb safely (very similar to indoor toproping). After that we climb for the rest of the day. LUAK fixes a group insurance for those who don't have one, this is free.

More info & registration will come after our info evening.
