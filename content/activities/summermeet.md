__Update 21/05:__ The camping municipal in Pralognan-la-Vanoise is closed this summer and the other camping is already full. This means that the summermeet will be in another location. Currently we are looking at Val di Mello as plan B 😃🏔. And if that also doesn't work out, the Ecrins is our backup of the backup.

Every year the people of LUAK spend a week together in the mountains🏔️. This year they are going to ~Pralognan-la-Vanoise~ from 12 July to 20 July.
So gather your climbing gear and [join our epic climging adventures](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK3zo8q2zVpw7AcXQUY4Hn31indHryk9CQLRiE9zSg0iphdQ/viewform?usp=dialog) in the Vanoise national park.

## What will we do

Short answer: we do whatever we want. But ofcourse we go to the alps for climbing.
In Pralognan there is some sport climbing close to the village, there are multipitches for all levels and alpinism (mostly beginner alpinism). There are also some very nice trails in Pralognan for some hiking for those that need a rest day.
You can already come and check out the topo @LUAK on a Thursday evening to make some cool summer plans 🧗.

## Practical information

🏕️ We'll be staying on a camping. More info about the practical arrangements for the camping will come later.\
🚗 For the transport we'll arrange a carpool, we also have one KUL van. For the KUL van (and also the carpool), diesel and peage will be distributed among the passengers.\
🚂 By public transport you can easily get to most places, ofthen the last part into the mountains is a bit more difficult. This part you can hitchhike or ask if someone from our group can come pick you up.\
⚙️ Climbing gear required: climbing shoes, harness and helmet. LUAK will bring a lot of gear (ropes, quickdraws, slings, carbiners, etc.). But it is good to bring your own gear because LUAK does not have gear for everyone.\
🍌 So make sure to buy enough food beforehand to last a week. Usually we stop somewhere on the way there to buy all the food.\
💵 The summermeet is free i.e. there is no registration fee (LUAK membership is required, which is 20€). Foresee about 200€ for your own expenses like food, transport, camping, etc.
