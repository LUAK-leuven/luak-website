**Update 26/05:** We changed the summermeet location to Val di Mello (so we will not be going to Pralognan-la-Vanoise, because the camping there was closed this summer).

Every year the people of LUAK spend a week together in the mountainsüèîÔ∏è. This year they are going to Val di Mello from 12 July to 20 July.
So gather your climbing gear and [join our epic climging adventures](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK3zo8q2zVpw7AcXQUY4Hn31indHryk9CQLRiE9zSg0iphdQ/viewform?usp=dialog) in the Italian alps.

## What will we do?

Short answer: we do whatever we want. But ofcourse we go to the alps for climbing.
Val di Mello is known to be one of the most beautiful mountain valleys in the alps. It is very popular for its vast amount of granite boulders. Besides bouldering there is also plenty of sports climbing, multipitching (a lot of trad multipitches) and some alpinism.

## Practical information

üèïÔ∏è We'll be staying on [camping Ground Jack](https://www.groundjack.it/home). Make sure to **make your own reservation!** Make sure to mention that you are part of LUAK when you reserve, this way we can all sit together. Also mention the number of people, tents and cars in your reservation. :br
üöó For the transport we'll arrange a carpool, we also have one KUL van. For the KUL van (and also the carpool), diesel and peage will be distributed among the passengers. :br
üöÇ By public transport it is possible to get all the way to Val Masino. From there it is only 2km to the camping, which you can simply hike, hitchhike, or ask someone to come and pick you up. :br
‚öôÔ∏è Climbing gear required: climbing shoes, harness and helmet. LUAK will bring a lot of gear (ropes, quickdraws, slings, carbiners, etc.). But it is good to bring your own gear because LUAK does not have gear for everyone. :br
üçå There is no grocery store in Val di Mello, so make sure to buy enough food beforehand to last a week. Usually we stop somewhere on the way there to buy all the food. There are small grocery stores just outside the valley in case you forget some stuff, but we won't be driving there every day (less is better). :br
üíµ The summermeet is free i.e. there is no registration fee (LUAK membership is required, which is 20‚Ç¨). Foresee about 200‚Ç¨ for your own expenses like food, transport, camping, etc.
