On the long weekend of 1-4 May we are going to the magical forests of Fontainebleau.

Because this is a bouldering trip, no experience with belaying or lead climbing is required. But don't underestimate the dangers of bouldering, there are more accidents with bouldering than sportclimbing! So make sure you know how to spot someone and how to safely fall on a crashpad. If you're not familiar with this it might be a good idea to check out some videos on youtoubeðŸ˜‰.

Because we don't have the KUL van and only few board members can join the weekend (the concequences of half the board being Mount CoachðŸ™ƒ), the style of weekend will be more of a meet in Font rather than a group trip. There is a [whatsapp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/H2EMTXskvhl9UFJzasAVVR) where carpooling can be arranged and practical information will be shared (like when we leave, where we'll sleep etc.). If you need crashpads, they can be borrowed at LUAK or you can also rent them in Font.
