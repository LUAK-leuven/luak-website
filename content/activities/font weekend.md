On the long weekend of 1-4 May we are going to the magical forests of Fontainebleau.

Because this is bouldering no experience is required.

We have the KUL van only from 2-4 May, so we'll probably go for only 3 days (after 2 days of climbing in Font you don't have any skin left anyway).

More info & registration will come later (probably the week before or so, updating the website like several months before the activity, whaaaatðŸ¤¯, does not mean we are getting more organizedðŸ˜œ)
