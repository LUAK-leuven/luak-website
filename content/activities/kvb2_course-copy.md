**KVB2 – Indoor lead climbing**

**WHAT IS THIS?**

A KVB, or KlimVaardigheidsBewijs, or climbing proficiency certificate, is a personal certificate that proves you have successfully completed one of the levels to become an independent (rock) climber. The Flemish climbing & mountaineering federation recognizes multiple levels, starting at KVB1 for indoor top roping, via KVB2 & KVB2+ for indoor and outdoor resp. single pitch lead climbing to more advanced outdoor rock-climbing courses (KVB3, KVB3+ and KVB4). The indoor lead climbing course (KVB2) teaches you all the techniques for safe, indoor lead climbing. In indoor lead climbing, the climber attaches the rope to the bolts on the wall while climbing. The rope follows the climber and is held at the bottom by the fuse. This course concludes with an evaluation moment to obtain the second level climbing proficiency certificate by the Flemish climbing, aka the KlimVaardigheidsBewijs 2, or KVB2. In most Flemish climbing gyms with the possibility of lead climbing, a KVB2 is required to gain access.

**COURSE CONTENT**

This course aims to teach you all the skills required for safe indoor lead climbing and belaying. We will build upon the skills from KVB1/ indoor top roping and expand our skill set. You will learn how to prepare for a lead climb, what extra gear you need and how to belay and lead itself. The course will be a practical course, with limited pragmatic theory. Some specific themes that will be covered are:

- Risk management and safety
- How to belay safely and what are some constraints we need to be aware of
- Gear management: which belay devices or ropes do we prefer for leading
- Dynamic belaying
- Leading basics and tips & tricks
- Taking lead falls & becoming comfortable with it
- Injury prevention

The course follows the curriculum by KVB, which can be found here (dutch only): <https://www.klimenbergsportfederatie.be/klimvaardigheidsbewijzen>

The course consists of 2 course evenings (each approximately 3hrs) + an evaluation (exam).

**THE EXAM**

It is important to understand that the KVB courses are courses you take to grow personally as a climber. Sure, passing an exam at the end is a nice proof that you acquired all the necessary skills and can apply them safely. But it should by no means be your objective, to pass the exam. The courses are aimed at teaching you how to progress as a climber so you can enjoy the sport safely with a smile. The exam is secondary.
