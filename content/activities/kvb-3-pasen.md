## **Course content - KVB 3**

A KVB3 course is a course to learn basic outdoor rock-climbing skills on well bolted climbs, ranging from single pitch to short multipitches. The course will build on the skills acquired during indoor top rope and indoor lead climbing skills. 

A course day starts at 9h00 and stops around 16h30. But be somewhat flexible, climbing is fun and some days we might be done later. In the evening, some theoretical courses will be given, mainly to prepare for the next day.

A day has the following structure:

07h00

Alarm goes off, but I still snooze a bit

07h30

Time to get up, eat something, do my morning routine

09h00

Start of the course. Ready and packed. Backpacks are already made, lunch packet is done, water bottles filled, I went to the toilet

09h00 – 11h30

Theory and practice on ground

11h30 – 12h30

Break to eat and to move to the rocks

12h30 – 16h30

Practice on the rocks what we learned in the morning

16h30 – 16h45

Reflection and feedback. Discuss planning for that evening and tomorrow’s climbing day, dinner plan, shop… 

18h30

Eat together as a group

Evening

Small theoretical lessons, chill, sleep, me-time…

**Day 0 – Preperation day**

Prior to the course, we will have a day/evening together to discuss how the stage is going to go and what to bring. This will be at the LUAK clubhouse, Thursday 26/03/2026. 

**Day 1** 

- Repeat KVB 2 skills
- KVB2+ skills – how to clean anchors
- Climb single pitch to practice in the afternoon

**Day 2**

- Anchor building and anchor recognition
- Belaying a second
- Intro to rappel
- Belay swaps at the anchor

**Day 3**

- Short multipitch essentials recap
- A near full day of climbing and the first multipitch, with anchor building and rappels

**Day 4** 

- Morning: rescue techniques: Express 3:1 pulley system and self-rescue (prusikken)
- Afternoon: practice, either on a short multipitch (2 to 3 pitches) or single pitch climbing

**Day 5 & 6**

- Small tips and tricks in no particular order (munter hitch, double rope system, order at the anchor, non-verbal communication, etc etc.)
- Practice and do. The best way to gain experience is to go out and climb.

There will not be a formal exam day. Afterwards, LUAK will organize a KVB3 exam moment for those who want to do exam. It is a deliberate choice not to organize an exam during this course. This way we maximize climbing and learning opportunities. The exam is only that, one short stressful moment, but the climbing itself is more valuable.

All instructors, (Sebastiaan Verbeke en Mo Vanstraelen) are passionate and experienced rock-climbing instructors, with a lot of experience, both in teaching and from climbing a lot themselves. 

### **Course material:** 

At the moment of the stage, KBF is working on a KVB3 instruction manual (in Dutch). We will let you know the moment this is in print. It is in part co-authored by Sebastiaan and Mo. If you are more a visual learner: go check out the Youtube-account of the club Vertical Thinking. We know those people too, and we like their videos. Why re-invent the wheel, if they already made nice videos.

### **Carpooling**

Carpooling will make the trip cheaper, and more ecofriendly. 

About 1.5 months before going, we will make a WhatsApp chat to arrange carpooling with all participants. LUAK does not provide a carpool van, though the instructors can definitely take some people with them if needed.

Public transport is also an option, but it’s France, so be ready for a planning adventure. Train and bus will be possible, but carpooling is just so much easier. 

If you carpool with someone, you split the costs fairly! 

### **Verblijf – Housing/Camping**

Because we are going to the south of France, and the weather is nearly always good, we will be staying on a campground. This also gives us more flexibility to look for suitable locations with unpredictable group sizes. Maybe, if the prices are similar, we’ll just go for a comfy house.

Price of housing/ camping is included in the course (not included: extra costs made at the campground such as laundry machines, drink, shower jetons…)

### **Catering**

Food and drinks are not included for the course week. We aim to all cook together, to promote being together as a group, not an assembly of individuals. If you do want your private evening rest moments away from the group, also fine, but eating together are good bonding moments. 

The day before the stage, we will need to go to the grocery store to supply, at least for the first days. During our Day 0 preparation day, we will already try to make a list of who eats what and what to buy, so it is less chaotic during the stage. Please don’t forget to mention allergies!

Normal food costs for the instructors will be covered by the participants. With normal, we mean the normal breakfast, lunch, normal diner stuff. Fancy extravagant meals are for the instructors themselves to pay.

We will also divide tasks on how to cook and clean, but this will happen somewhat organically. If somebody loves to cook, we hope that the rest of the group loves to do the dishes!

### **Materiaal - Gear**
