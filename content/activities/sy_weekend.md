The weekend of 25-26 October we are going to Sy, a cosy climbing crag near the Ourthe river. This weekend is meant for beginner lead climbers. We will not give a full KVB2 course, but we'll happily explain everything you need to know in order to lead climb safely on the rocks (so at least knowing how lead climbing works is a plus). Of course experienced climbers can also join!

For this activity you need to be **member of KBF** or another federation affiliated to the UIAA. For the transport we'll arrange a carpool. Sy is also (very) accessible by the train (there is a train station in Sy).

We will stay overnight on the camping in Sy. A tent and sleeping gear are required. Let us know in the registration form if you still need something.

Registrations for the weekend will open after the initiations.
