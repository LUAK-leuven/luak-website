The weekend of 5-6 April we are going to Pont-à-Lesse. This weekend is meant for beginner lead climbers. We will not give a full KVB2 course, but we'll happily explain everything you need to know in order to lead climb safely on the rocks (so at least knowing how lead climbing works is a plus). Of course experienced climbers can also join (or go climbing in Freyr or Plain des Fosses and join the campfire in the evening).

For this activity you need to be **member of KBF** or another federation affiliated to the UIAA. For the transport we have the KUL van (only for people with a sportscard) and we'll arrange a carpool. Pont-a-lesse is also accessible with the train to Anseremme and 40min hike.

We will stay overnight on the bivouac spot in Freyr. A tent and sleeping gear are required. Let us know if you still need something. Also bring €2 cash to pay for the bivouac (it's a small fee to help pay for the accommodations there).

Bring food for the weekend (there is a store in Anseremme, but we lose less time if everyone brings their own food). In the evening usually we eat fries at the Colébi, close to the bivouac.

Registrations for the weekend will open after the initiation.
