For All Saints' Day's long weekend we're heading to the Eifel region in Germany, more specifically Ettringen. This is a climbing area famous for its crack climbing and it is for the most part not bolted, especially in the easier routes (read: below 7th grade) so this trip will be most enjoyable for those already familiar and comfortable using trad climbing gear, or those willing to learn fast and not too scared ;) Who is coming to join us in this crack-sportclimbing paradise?
