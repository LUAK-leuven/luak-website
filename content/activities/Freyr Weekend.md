Freyr, home of the gods, the epicentre of the universe. On the weekend of 8-9 March we will again go to Freyr for an epic weekend. A Freyr weekend typically consists of beautifull climbing during the day, a campfireðŸ”¥ (and possibly some crasy night-time climbs or swimming) in the evening.

### Practical

- **KBF membership** (or another climbing federation affiliated with the UIAA) and **LUAK membership** are required.
- Lead climbing is a must. This is not an initiation, for beginners we have the [initiation](https://www.luak.be/activities/intiation) and the [Pont-a-Lesse weekend](https://www.luak.be/activities/pal_weekend).
- Transport:
  - Freyr is accessible by train (train to Anseremme + 40min hike along the Maas). In total it is about 3h which seems kinda long, but don't worry the diehard 'Freyrianen' of LUAK do this every week.
  - We'll also organise a carpool, the amount of places obviously depends on how many people have a car with extra places.
- We'll stay overnight in the bivouac area in Freyr. So a tent and sleeping gear are required. Also bring 2â‚¬ cash to pay for the bivouac.
- Bring enough food for a whole weekend. Usually we go eat fries in the Colebi in the evening. There is fresh water near the bivouac area.
