Freyr, home of the gods, the epicentre of the universe. On the weekend of 27-28 September we will again go to Freyr for an epic weekend. A Freyr weekend typically consists of beautifull climbing during the day, a campfire🔥 (and possibly some crasy night-time climbs or swimming) in the evening.

### Practical

- **KBF membership** (or another climbing federation affiliated with the UIAA) and **LUAK membership** are required.
- **Lead climbing** is a **must**. This is not an initiation, for beginners we have the initiations and the Sy weekend (find them on our [activities page](/activities).
- Transport:
  - We (probably) have a KUL van for the weekend (only for people with a KUL sportscard). We'll organise a carpool, the total amount of places obviously depends on how many people have a car with extra places.
  - Freyr is accessible by train (train to Anseremme + 40min hike along the Maas). In total it is about 3h which seems kinda long, but don't worry the diehard 'Freyrianen' of LUAK do this every week.
- We'll stay overnight in the bivouac area in Freyr. So a tent and sleeping gear are required. Also bring 3€ cash to pay for the bivouac.
- Bring enough food for a whole weekend. Usually we go eat fries in the Colebi in the evening. There is fresh water and a dry toilet near the bivouac area.
