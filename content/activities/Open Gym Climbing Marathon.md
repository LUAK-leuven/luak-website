Have you ever wondered how many boulders you can climb in one climbing session. Or have you always wanted to sleep on your favourite OG crashpad? Well, on Saturday 16 November LUAK is organising a climbing marathon ðŸ§— and sleepover â›º in Open Gym!

Registration link: <https://forms.gle/98cBJwWT3h9VCCSN8>

On the planning we have: - The climbing marathon from 14h to 20h. The goal is to climb as many boulders as possible (for the die-hards it is possible to keep climbing all night long (-> category 2)). There are also some cool prices for the people that climb the most boulders. - A potluck, starting 20h00, and a campfireðŸ”¥ - After that, sleeping in OG ðŸ˜´ - On Sunday morning we will provide breakfast for â‚¬4.

For the sleepover you need to bring:

Â - A sleeping bag (warm enough)

Â - A sleeping mat (for extra comfort on the crashpads)

See you on Saturday, November 16th,

LOLL (Lots Of LUAK Love)
