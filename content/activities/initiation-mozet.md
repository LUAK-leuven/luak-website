Our rock climbing initiations are a great opportunity to make your first experience with rock climging. The experienced people from LUAK will hang topropes and explain how to climb and belay safely. After that it is up to you!

Practical:

- We will organise a carpool for transport.
- LUAK will provide climbing gear for you (if you already have some climbing gear, feel free to bring it).
- The activity lasts all day long. We will leave in the morning and will be back in the evening.

:br You can register during one of our info evenings.
We will only open the online registration after the second info evening. Usually the initiations are almost instantly full (due to the limited amount of places and high demand). Therefore we also ask to only register if you are sure you can come, and let us know (in advance!) if you cannot make it anymore.
